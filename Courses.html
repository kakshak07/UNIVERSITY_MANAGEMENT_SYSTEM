		<li><h2>Computer Science and Engineering</h2></li>
		<p><p>Computer Science & Engineering in Vellore Institute of Technology is among the most sought after engineering branch in India with most of the VIT Advance toppers opting for the same across all different university located across India.hat IT sector has emerged as one of the highest growing sectors is not the only reason for students looking for Computer Science & Engineering (CSE). There are plentiful job opportunities for a Computer Science graduate, and that too in the world’s top companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Deloitte, and a lot more. Additionally, Computer Science Engineers are paid fairly in the industry and they also have high growth opportunity given the evolving dynamics of the IT sector across the world.With the coveted Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) branch in VITs comprising just about 10 per cent of the total seats available with all VITs, getting a CSE seat at prestigious VITs has always been a tough proposition for engineering aspirants.<br><br>

		<li><h2>Mechanical Engineering</h2></li>
		<p><p>
			The School of Mechanical and Building Sciences (SMBS) offering the 4 year B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) degree programme. All courses are made student-centric instead of teacher-centric. Learning becomes more ‘experiential’ by carrying out a project as part of most of the courses. ‘Learning by doing’ enhances understanding the concepts discussed in the class and make multi- and cross- disciplinary applications possible. Students will be able to take up real world problems as their course projects and apply their key learning in identifying better solutions. All courses under CAL are designed to bring out the importance of application to engineering/technological problems, creativity and innovation, developing entrepreneurial skills, rather than route learning. Students get industrial exposure by doing four weeks of industrial internship at the end of second year. Industrial visits and guest lectures are arranged for each course to enhance the knowledge. Students can design their own car and participate in the international/ national events like Baja Student India Competition, Formula Green Championship, etc. Also students can do their final year project in foreign universities under Semester Abroad Program (SAP). In the campus placement, B.Tech Mechanical students are placed in many core companies such as Tech Mahindra, Honda, Ford, Hyundai, Escorts, TVS, Yamaha and Asian Paints.<br><br>
